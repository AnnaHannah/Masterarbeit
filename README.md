**Abstract**

This study explores the scaling potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in platform and
service startups, focusing on the economic implications of AI-driven growth models. By
analyzing approximately 17,000 startups from the PitchBook database and applying
regression models inspired by West (2019) and Schulte-Althoff, Fürstenau, and Lee (2021)
scaling approach, it was found that AI-powered service startups have significantly higher
scaling rates than their non-AI service counterparts, with scaling exponents on average 0.6
to 2.53 times higher. Specifically, the scaling exponents for gross profit and venture capital
increased from 0.7 for non-AI service startups to 1.0 for AI-enabled service startups, and
revenue scaling exponents rose from 1.1 for non-AI service startups to 2.9 for AI service
startups.

The study also examines various locations and industries of startups, revealing that AI
plays a crucial role in reshaping traditional growth patterns across different sectors and
regions.

The results indicate that artificial intelligence significantly enhances the scaling capa-
bilities of service startups, enabling them to achieve faster and more effective growth.
However, this advantage does not extend to platform startups, where AI does not appear
to have the same impact. By highlighting the simplicity of scaling formulas, the study
illustrates their practical usage in evaluating the innovation potential and growth prospects
of AI-based business models. While the findings are more descriptive than predictive, they
still offer valuable insights for researchers, investors, and founders seeking to leverage AI
as a strategic tool to gain a competitive edge in an increasingly digital economy.

**Extracts from the work**

**Definition of AI**
AI is a rapidly evolving field not only in business but also in research. To pinpoint
what AI is, I decided to use a quantitative method to deduce the definition of AI in
the current research literature.

The keyword analysis in bibliometrics provides an overview of keywords used
together in scientific publications on any subject. Figure 2.1 depicts a result of my
bibliometric analysis of 111 articles regarding the research question.
Further details for literature, data, search queries, paper preparation, and analyzing
options are explained in Appendix 8.1.

It is reasonable to interpret the mind map of keywords in Figure 2.1 as a visual
representation of current research topics as seen by the five leading ”Information
Systems” journals.

The size of a node indicates how frequently a keyword is mentioned. A node that
is double the size indicates that the keyword is used twice as often. From the mind
map, it is evident that "Artificial Intelligence" is one of the most commonly used
terms. It can be defined as a central concept that connects and influences various
domains.
The mind map in Figure 2.1 and Table 2.1 illustrate that "Artificial Intelligence" is
a complex and interconnected concept encompassing various technological, economic,
ethical, and strategic dimensions. This analysis shows that the literature on the
topic relates to multiple scientific fields, including information systems, business
administration, computer science, and several other disciplines. Based on the graph
in Figure 2.1, I define "Artificial Intelligence" as follows:

******Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a technological concept that relies on machine
learning for digital transformation. It is often used in connection with areas
such as entrepreneurship, startups, innovation, and transformative business
models. AI is influenced by data quality and data analytics processes, and it
plays a central role in the development of digital capabilities, for example, in
platforms. It promotes automation and innovation, providing companies with
opportunities to advance their strategy through data analytics, technologies,
and technological changes.******

**Selection of Key Variables**

The extensive dataset in PitchBook includes numerous variables that are suitable for
analysis. Drawing inspiration from the scaling analysis conducted by Schulte-Althoff
et al. (2021), I have identified key variables that align with the criteria for scaling
analysis. Additionally, the scaling analysis from West further informed the selection
of these scaling variables.

This study examines the selected variables presented in Table 3.3.

**Research question 1: Does AI in the core of business models influence
the scaling efficiency of service startups?**

Yes, when comparing companies with more than 80 employees (for those
without AI business models) and more than 100 employees (for those with AI
business models), service AI startups have a scaling exponent that is 0.60 to
2.53 times higher than that of non-AI service startups.
The scaling analyses with revenue, gross profit, and VC raised as variables
support this finding: AI in service startups brings higher scalability or growth.
However, these findings do not have a robust predictive power but are more
descriptive.

**Research question 2: Does AI in core business models influence
platform startups’ scaling efficiency?**

No. With my methods, no answer could be given below the marks of 15 (for
those without AI business models) or 70 employees (for those with AI business
models). Above those marks, with the removal of the top 1% revenue achievers,
a ”No” would be the answer. The scaling analysis with other variables like net
income, gross profit, and VC raised also supports this finding by showing that
these two categories of startups do not follow the ”universal” scaling pattern.
However, these findings do not have a strong predictive power; rather, they
are more descriptive.
